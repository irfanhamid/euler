This is a problem solving repository. Mostly to prepare for interviews. Each directory will contain one problem and its solution.

euler
  |---> shared: basic data structure definitions
  |---> euler: the solutions to problems from the http://eulerproject.net
          |---> *
  |---> trees: problems based on trees, traversal, searches, etc.
          |---> traversals: iterative implementations of the inorder, preorder and postorder traversals
          |---> predsuc: predecessor and successor functions for BSTs  
          |---> reconstruct: rebuild a tree from its inorder and preorder traversals
  |---> strings: problems based on strings
          |---> reverse: reverse a string in-place, i.e., without using auxiliary storage space
          |---> reversewords: reverse the words in a string in-place
          |---> longestunique: find the longest unique substring of a string, assuming ASCII characters
          |---> longestpalindrome: find the longest palindrome in a string
  |---> linklist: problems based on link lists
          |---> arblink: reconstruct a link list which has one next and one arbitrary pointer pointing to any node in the link list
  |---> graphs: graph search algorithms
  |---> esoteric: just what the name says
