This is a problem solving repository. Mostly to prepare for interviews. Each directory will contain one problem and its solution.

 euler

   |---> shared: basic data structure definitions

   |---> euler: the solutions to problems from the http://eulerproject.net

   |---> trees: problems based on trees, traversal, searches, etc.

          |---> traversals: iterative implementations of the inorder, preorder and postorder traversals

          |---> predsuc: predecessor and successor functions for BSTs  

          |---> reconstruct: rebuild a tree from its inorder and preorder traversals

   |---> strings: problems based on strings
 
          |---> reverse: reverse a string in-place, i.e., without using auxiliary storage space

          |---> reversewords: reverse the words in a string in-place

          |---> longestunique: find the longest unique substring of a string, assuming ASCII characters

          |---> longestpalindrome: find the longest palindrome in a string

   |---> linklist: problems based on link lists

          |---> arblink: reconstruct a link list which has one next and one arbitrary pointer pointing to any node in the link list

   |---> graphs: graph search algorithms

          |---> reconstruct: given an adjacency list, reconstruct a graph, even if it has cycles
   
   |---> backtrack: problems involving search w/ backtracking
          
          |---> ratmaze: rat finds all possible paths from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) in a maze

   |---> esoteric: just what the name says
